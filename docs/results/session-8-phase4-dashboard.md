# Result: Session 8 - Phase 4 (Visualization Dashboard)

## Overview
Phase 4 completes the "Hollywood Script Intelligence System" by providing a high-fidelity visual interface for stakeholders. We have bridged the AI Orchestration Engine (Core) to a Next.js Dashboard via a RESTful API.

## Key Features Built & Verified

### A. Backend Bridge (Elysia.js)
- **Path:** `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- **Capabilities:** 
  - `POST /analyze`: Receives fountain text, triggers the full multi-LLM/Predictor pipeline, and returns a unified JSON report.
  - `GET /report/:id`: Retrieves cached analysis results.
  - **Monorepo Integration:** Uses the `@scenario-analysis/core` workspace package directly.

### B. Premium Dashboard UI (Next.js)
- **Path:** `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/`
- **Visual Design:** Implemented a "Glassmorphism" dark theme with a radial gradient background and blurred panels for a premium AI aesthetic.
- **Analytics Widgets:**
  - **Emotion Arc Chart:** A smoothed Area Chart (Recharts) mapping scene numbers to emotional valence (-10 to 10).
  - **Narrative Beat Sheet:** A horizontal timeline of Act-based story beats.
  - **Character Rankings:** Dynamic cards listing the Protagonist, Antagonist, and supporting cast based on dialogue density.
  - **Investment HUD:** Real-time badges for Predicted ROI (`Blockbuster`, `Hit`) and MPAA Rating.

## How to Run the System
1. **Start Backend**: `cd apps/api && bun run dev` (Port 3001)
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd apps/web && bun run dev` (Port 3000)
3. **View Dashboard**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

## Status
- **Verification**: Verified the UI rendering with Fight Club sample data. API endpoints successfully tested.
- **Milestone**: The 4-stage development process (Ingestion, Parsing, Analysis, Prediction, Output) is now fully realized as a functional software system.
