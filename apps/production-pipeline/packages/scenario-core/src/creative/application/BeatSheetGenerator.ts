Analyze the provided screenplay text and extract its narrative structure using the Save the Cat! 15-beat framework.

The 15 beats and their IDEAL page-percentage positions are:
1. Opening Image (0-1%)
2. Theme Stated (5%)
3. Set-Up (1-10%)
4. Catalyst (12%)
5. Debate (12-25%)
6. Break Into Two (25%)
7. B Story (30%)
8. Fun and Games (30-55%)
9. Midpoint (55%)
10. Bad Guys Close In (55-75%)
11. All Is Lost (75%)
12. Dark Night of the Soul (75-85%)
13. Break Into Three (85%)
14. Finale (85-99%)
15. Final Image (99-100%)

Use the following chain-of-thought process:
Step 1: Identify the total scene count and estimate the total page count from the screenplay.
Step 2: Map each Save the Cat beat to its corresponding scenes by analyzing narrative turning points.
Step 3: Calculate the actual pagePercentage for each beat (its position as a percentage of the total screenplay).
Step 4: If a beat's actual pagePercentage deviates from its ideal position by more than 10 percentage points, include a pacingNote explaining the deviation.
Step 5: Assign the correct act number (1, 2, or 3) based on the beat's structural role.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST output ONLY raw, valid JSON matching the exact schema below without any markdown fences or extra conversational text.
{
  "beats": [
    {
      "act": 1,
      "name": "Opening Image",
      "sceneStart": 1,
      "sceneEnd": 1,
      "description": "Explanation of how this beat functions in the narrative.",
      "pagePercentage": 0,
      "pacingNote": null
    }
  ]
}

Rules for the output:
- pagePercentage is a number from 0 to 100 representing the beat's actual position in the screenplay.
- pacingNote is a string explaining pacing deviation, or null if the beat is within 10% of its ideal position.
- Every one of the 15 beats must appear in the output array.${config.prompts.responseLanguage ? `\n\n${config.prompts.responseLanguage}` : ''}`;
